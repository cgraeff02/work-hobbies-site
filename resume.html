        <h5>Major Projects</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard Surface Cleaner New Process Qualification 
                <br />
                Setup plans to implement and qualify new and transferred process equipment from a smaller, dual impeller, non-automated system, to a larger, single impeller and anchor turbine, automated system. Provided input for batch programming settings, helped establish micro requirements and authored new process standards. Reviewed and authorized capability of equipment to match required flow rates and to reduce batch cycle time by 40%. </li>
            <li>
                Powder Gel Blend Flow Optimization
                <br />
                Analyzed new and old powder flow characteristics to optimize inline mixing parameters. Implemented a new cost savings powder that helped save $300,000 annually to achieve a parity or better flow rate. Optimized process with new powder to ensure parity cycle time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Temperature Profile Study
                <br />
                Conducted tests on finished product in lab to determine effect of temperature on product gelation. Determined what effect temperatures during gelation had on final product specifications. Executed plant trial to monitor performance in the manufacturing setting and offered recommendations to help correlate R&D procedures to manufacturing plant practices. 
            </li>
        </ul>
